# TeamOps-BI
This project is an input‑driven web app for entering and updating team and project data into a MySQL database, which then feeds a polished, interactive dashboard in the Power BI service complete with scheduled refreshes, role‑based access, and real‑time insights into developer workload, project ratings, and performance trends.
